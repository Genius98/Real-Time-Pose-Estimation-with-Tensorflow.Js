# Real Time Pose Estimation with Tensorflow.Js and Javascript

What ever pose user are trying to strike, real time pose estimation can help! Pose estimation uses deep learning to detect different joints within user body from an image and pieces them together to determine a human pose. Here I Install Posenet and Tensorflow.js , Set up a real-time webcam feed using React-Webcam & lastly display it all inside a web app using React.

ps.My web cam is super old which is why it didn't run smoothly.
